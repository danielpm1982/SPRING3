[DESCRIPTION OF THIS REPOSITORY]

For basic Spring Projects NOT using MAVEN, using Hibernate/JPA and using only SpringCore, SpringMVC and SpringAOP modules, see: https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING . And, for intermediate-level Spring Projects, using MAVEN, and more Spring Modules, see: https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING2. All projects here have been created with Java JDK 13 and IntelliJ Ultimate IDE. JAVA13+ compatible.

[UPDATE FEB-2020]
This repository is a collection of FINISHED projects, with no .git commit history (for each project separately) and NOT subject to change or contributions. The purpose of this and of other similar "academics" repositories in my account has been merely to store finished projects in a cloud backup, not for continuous or shared development. In case you wanna follow, issue, fork or contribute with pull requests to UNDER DEVELOPMENT projects of mine, please look for the individual repo of each respective project in my account (https://github.com/danielpm1982?tab=repositories), instead of in these "academics" repos. From now on, when under development projects are finished, I'll keep copying them to "academics" repos (as unmodifiable backup and with no .git history) but I'll start leaving the original development repos undeleted at my account as well... with all .git commit and other git objects history available in them.
